quotes on main page are about old book?

advice:
added a little bio on the front page (from goodreads i think)

would advice to leave out the reviews (there is already an extra page of reviews and it makes it messy) or at least reduce it to MAX 4


left out july coupon bit

left out pictures of last book but added little (clickable) slideshow 

would leave out the women&home bit and rather have that on the personal page and update  when there is news, or have extra news page

would consider having less pages: reviews on books page, newsletter on contact page? events on news page?

books: want just the newest one at the top display or both last ones?
