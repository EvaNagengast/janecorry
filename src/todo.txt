quotes on main page are about old book?

advice:
added a little bio on the front page (from goodreads i think)
would advice to leave out the reviews (there is already an extra page of reviews and it makes it messy) 
left out july bit
would add a little slide show with all books
left out pictures of old book
would leave out the women&home bit and rather have that on the personal page and update that when there is things like that
