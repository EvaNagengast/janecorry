        WRITING TIPS People often ask me whether the plot should come first or
        the character. Personally, I think it is a mixture of both. But the
        glimmer of a plot always comes to me first of all. Then I will
        immediately start to ‘people’ it with at least two very different
        characters who will bring that plot to life. A convincing character will
        have personality traits and motives which then direct the way the story
        is going. For instance, in my new novel COMING TO FIND YOU, Nancy keeps
        thinking about the past. What is she scared of? That is revealed at the
        end ! HOW TO COME UP WITH AN IDEA FOR A STORY Make a list of big things
        that have happened to you such as: Moving house Getting married Going on
        holiday Starting a new job Getting stuck in a lift. Losing something
        important. Now ask yourself the question ‘What if?’ What if something
        different had happened during one of these experiences. For example,
        what if you went on holiday and ended up in a different destination from
        the one you thought you were going to? What if you were sacked on your
        first day of a new job? Could that lead to a different career? ‘What
        if?’ is a great way to get the imagination working!{" "}
